# PETs-Applications

A list of applications using Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs).

PET is a great helper for promoting stronger and deeper analysis of problems in our society. However, trustworthy and carefully designed PET applications are still rare.

Here we provide a list of the PETs applications dealing with this problem. 


## Applications

- **Differential Privacy** - [Privacy-Preserving Research Data Sharing](differential_privacy/privacy-preserving_research_data_sharing)
    - The application uses differential privacy to ensure patient privacy before releasing data for diabetes prediction.

- **Federated Learning** - [Financial Fraud Detection](federated_learning/financial_fraud_detection)
    - The application uses federated learning to ensure client privacy when building a fraud detection system with multiple financial institutions.

- **Homomorphic Encryption** - [Criminal Data Cloud Computing](homomorphic_encryption/criminal_data_cloud_computing)
    - The application uses homomorphic encryption to ensure personal privacy when computing data on the cloud.
