# Shared Diabetes Prediction Research Data

In this case, we have two roles, which are a data owner and multiple data analysts. The data owner (e.g., NIH) is in possession of a sensitive dataset (e.g., diabetes dataset). The analysts are all interested in the diabetes dataset. Unfortunately, the sensitive dataset cannot be released directly due to privacy concerns. Thus, a common goal shared by the data owner and data analysts is to have a surrogate dataset such that the diabetes dataset will not be leaked but the analysts can still derive some statistics or build up machine learning models. 

## Dataset

The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES I) was initiated in 1971-1974, surveying 23,808 U.S. civilians aged 1-74. In 1981, a follow-up was begun to evaluate coronary heart disease risk factors in the U.S. The major risk factors from earlier Framingham studies were confirmed relevant for the U.S. white adult population. By 1986, the surviving NHANES I cohort (around 12,500) was re-contacted. The NHLBI funded subsequent NHANES phases. NHANES III, beginning in 1988, incorporated new features like long-term specimen banking and oversampling of Blacks and Hispanics. This series evaluated heart, vascular, lung, and blood diseases, comparing results with studies like CARDIA and the Framingham Heart Study to gauge their national representativeness. Data collection for NHANES III had two waves from 1989-1994. In 2005-2006, with cooperation from NIAID and NIEHS, an allergy component was added to NHANES to understand asthma and the impact of indoor allergens and endotoxin on allergic diseases. Objectives included estimating nationwide allergen exposure, allergic sensitization prevalence, and prevalence of major allergic diseases. The component measures allergen-specific immunoglobulin E, collects dust samples for allergen analysis, and includes added questionnaires. NHANES offers a unique database, capturing both environmental and clinical data, aiding research on links like diet, obesity, and genetics in allergic disease development.

## Used PETs

Differential Privacy

## Goals of Using PETs

To protect the information of participants involved in the NHANES data collection, measures must be taken to prevent these participants from being targeted and inferred. Additionally, the released data should retain a significant degree of usability for subsequent observation or data analysis.

## Data Processing

For the NHANES dataset to be released in a way to satisfy differential privacy, we must first find a way to generate the data. Noise is injected into the output of functions involving statistical computations. An intuitive approach is to convert the data distribution into a contingency table and then inject DP noise into each count value. The noisy contingency table is converted back to the releasable dataset by sampling according to the new but noisy statistical distribution. The figure below shows an overall procedure of the differentially private data synthesis. We note that the in the figure below, the post-processing techniques such as integrality, non-negativity, and consistency are also included to enhance the quality of the synthetic dataset. However, such post-processing techniques are optional.

## Quick Start
### Environment Requirements

- Python version must be greater than `3.7.1` and less than `3.11`.

### Step 1: Install `smartnoise-synth`

Open your terminal and enter the following commands:

```
pip install smartnoise-synth
pip install openDP==0.6.2
pip install swifter
```

> **Note:** When running `pip install openDP==0.6.2`, you may see an error in red indicating that `smartnoise-synth` requires `openDP` version to be `>= 0.7.0`. However, due to the lack of a specific API required by `smartnoise-synth` in `openDP` versions after `0.7.0`, we choose to install version `0.6.2`.

### Step 2: Clone the Sample Code

Open your terminal and enter the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/moda-gov-tw/PETs-Applications
```

### Step 3: Run the Sample Code

Open your terminal and enter the following commands:

```
cd differential_privacy/privacy-preserving_research_data_sharing 
python3 example_DP.py
```
